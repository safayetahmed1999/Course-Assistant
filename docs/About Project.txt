Our project will have 2 main parts. Result tracking and university's educational content sharing within own university.
In the tracking part, it will analyze and predict result based on given data also can visually represent data and 
analysis results. Based on results it will give tips to improve. Another part of our project will be content sharing.
In this part, each student can share their course materials and their own written notes, blogs etc. to help newcomers.
Others can view, search these as they want. 
Content will be suggested on the home page based on their department and results. There will also be an option to request 
a specific course. However all sharing and caring will only stay inside own university for privacy reasons.
